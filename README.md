- 👋 Hi, my name is Connor, I am a recent grduate from college with a B.A in Cyber Security.
- 👀 When I am not at work, I am working on side projects, streaming, and going to the gym.
- 🌱 I am currently moving my way through my field, and hoping to get into security very soon. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on side jobs for programming to get me experience up.
- 📫 The best way to get into contact with me would be sending me an email or shooting me a message on Discord.
